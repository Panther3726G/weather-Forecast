# weather-Forecast
A complete Time Series Weather Forecasting project using Python, ARIMA/LSTM, and real-time data preprocessing. Includes EDA, feature engineering, model training, and future temperature prediction.
# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on forecasting future weather parameters (such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall) using **Time Series Machine Learning models**.  
It covers the complete workflow — from data cleaning and visualization to model building and prediction.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

- Built a **Time Series Forecasting** model using ARIMA/LSTM.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand weather patterns.
- Handled **missing values, trends, seasonality**, and created lag features.
- Trained the model on historical weather data and predicted future values.
- Visualized actual vs predicted results for performance evaluation.

## 🧠 **Tech Stack**

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels / ARIMA**
- **TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM)**
- **Scikit-learn**
